# Raspberry Pi Camera Module
We use almost exclusively the v2 camera module, which has a better sensor and a better lens.  The design should also work with v1, though removing the lens will be considerably harder.

Newer camera modules come with an included plastic tool for removing the lens - this is much better than the printed tool and should definitely be used in preference.
