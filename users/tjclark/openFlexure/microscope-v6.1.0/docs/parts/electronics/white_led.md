The white LED is for illumination.  Exact specifications are unimportant, but this is the one I use - it is the "warmest" white I could find, as this means the wavelength range is closer to a filament bulb.  5mm diameter is what I've designed for, but there's no reason you couldn't tweak the illumination arm to use a 3mm LED.
