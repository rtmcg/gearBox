## Step
You need wires to connect the LED to the 5V power supply from the Raspberry Pi.  If you've bought a kit, it will be supplied with a ready-made lead that has the LED at one end and the header connector at the other end.  My preferred DIY option is two cores from a ribbon cable, soldered to the LED and resistor at one end and with a crimped-on connector at the other.  If you want a no-soldering solution, four female-female jumpers allow you to connect everything (using a cut-off leg of the resistor to join two of them together).
