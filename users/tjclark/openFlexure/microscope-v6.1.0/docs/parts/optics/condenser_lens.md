# Condenser Lens

## Details
*   **Focal length:** 5mm
*   **Outer diameter:** 12.7mm
*   **Material:** PMMA

The illumination needs a condenser lens, and so far I have generally sourced these in bulk from China.  They are designed for collimating LEDs, and don't produce a beautiful image, but they are adequate for our purposes.  Searching AliExpress for ``pmma lens 5mm`` and looking for a diameter of 13mm usually brings up the right thing.  Previous links aren't very useful as they don't stay alive for very long.
