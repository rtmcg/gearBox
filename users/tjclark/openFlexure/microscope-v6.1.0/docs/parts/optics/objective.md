The microscope should accept most RMS-threaded objective lenses, and depending on whether you use the sample riser it will use either 35mm or 45mm parfocal distance.  These objectives can typically be scavenged from old equipment, or obtained very cheaply on AliExpress.  We recommend going for Plan or Semi-Plan corrected lenses at 40x, and definitely Plan corrected or better at 100x.
