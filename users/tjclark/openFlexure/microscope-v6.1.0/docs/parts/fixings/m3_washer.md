The washers fit between the gears and the microscope to provide a metal bearing surface.  It's important to use two washers under each gear, so that the friction occurs between two metal surfaces rather than between plastic and metal surfaces.  Additional washers are used as fasteners, e.g. for the adjustable illumination arm.  We recommend steel washers.
