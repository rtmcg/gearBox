These screws attach the sample clips, optics module, illumination, and various other parts.  Exactly how many you need will depend on microscope options - it's safest to make sure you have a handful.  These don't need to be particularly fine quality, but cap head (i.e. driven with a hex key) will make some steps easier, particularly inserting the optics module.
