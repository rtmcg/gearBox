# Reflection/fluorescence cube

The filter cube allows for reflection illumination, by inserting a 50/50 beamsplitter filter into the 45 degree slot. It also enables fluorescence microscope, by instead inserting a dichroic filter in the 45 degree slot, and a long-pass filter in the bottom slot.

The cube is provided in a single file ``fl_cube.stl``.

Note, this must be used in conjunction with the [reflection illuminator](./reflection_illuminator.md).
