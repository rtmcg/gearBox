# Camera Platform
This part mounts the camera onto the body of the microscope, and is the counterpart to the [lens spacer](./lens_spacer.md).  If you are using the lens that came with your webcam, you should probably use this option for the optics module - the one-piece [optics module casing](./optics_module_casing.md) replaces this part if you are building a high resolution microscope.

## STL File
The STL file for this part is called ``camera_platform_<camera>_LS65.stl`` where ``<camera>`` is currently either ``6led`` or ``picamera_2``.  This allows it to be used with either the $3 6-LED webcams favoured by various low-cost instruments, or the Raspberry Pi camera module.
