# Small gears
If you fit motors to the microscope, the motors need small gears on them to mesh with the large [gears](./gears.md) that control the microscope.  You need three gears, and the STL file provides all 3.  NB the gears have a flat lip around the bottom - this is to help them stick to the print bed and avoid the teeth being distorted, so it should be at the bottom when printed.
